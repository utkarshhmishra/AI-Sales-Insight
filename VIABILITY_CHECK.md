- SLA commitments (99.5% uptime for Enterprise)
- Liability limitations

**Web Scraping Legality** - ⚠️ Gray Area:
- LinkedIn scraping: Technically against ToS
- Public website scraping: Generally acceptable (robots.txt compliant)
- **Mitigation**: Transition to official APIs, use publicly available data

### 7.5 Risk Mitigation

**Operational Risks**:

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| LLM API outage | Medium | High | Multi-provider fallback (OpenAI + Anthropic) |
| Data source blocking | Medium | Medium | Rotate IPs, respect rate limits, official APIs |
| Key team member leaves | Low | High | Knowledge documentation, cross-training |
