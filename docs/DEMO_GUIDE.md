## 🔥 Handling Live Demo Issues

### If Backend Won't Start
**Backup Plan:**
1. Show pre-recorded video of working demo
2. Walk through code instead
3. Show API documentation
4. Focus on architecture slides

**Prevention:**
- Test 30 minutes before
- Have terminals pre-configured
- Keep backup recording ready

### If API is Slow
**What to Say:**
- "Notice the loading indicator - agents are gathering real-time data"
- "In production, we'd cache frequently accessed companies"
- "The slight delay shows real API calls, not mock data"

### If Something Crashes
**Recovery:**
1. Stay calm
2. Say: "Let me show you the architecture while we reconnect"
3. Switch to diagrams/code
4. If time allows, restart
5. If not, continue with slides

**Never Say:**
- "This usually works"
- "I don't know why it's not working"
- "Let me just skip this"

**Always Say:**
- "Let me show you the design principles instead"
- "The architecture is what's important here"
- "I have a recording of this working if you'd like to see it later"

## 📋 Post-Demo Q&A

### Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: How accurate is the data?**
A: "We use reliable APIs like NewsAPI, Yahoo Finance, LinkedIn. Each agent provides a confidence score. For production, we'd add human-in-the-loop verification for critical decisions."

**Q: What about API costs?**
A: "For MVP, we use free tiers - NewsAPI (100/day), Alpha Vantage (5/min). For production, costs are ~₹2-5 per query. With caching (24h TTL), it's ~₹5k/month for 100 companies."

**Q: How is this different from ZoomInfo or Salesforce Einstein?**
A: "ZoomInfo is expensive ($15k+/year) and focuses on contact data. Einstein is CRM-locked and not real-time. We're contextual, real-time, and 10x cheaper."

**Q: Can you add custom data sources?**
A: "Absolutely! Agent architecture is modular. Adding a new agent takes ~200 lines of code. For example, we could add a competitor analysis agent or patent monitoring agent."

**Q: What about data privacy/GDPR?**
A: "We only use publicly available data. No PII storage. In production, we'd add GDPR-compliant data handling, user consent, right-to-deletion, and data encryption."

**Q: Why not just use ChatGPT?**
A: "ChatGPT's knowledge cutoff is outdated. We need real-time data. Also, our agents provide structured output, source attribution, and confidence scores - crucial for business decisions."
